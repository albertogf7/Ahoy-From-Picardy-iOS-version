# Ahoy-From-Picardy-iOS-version
iOS version of my scripts for "Ahoy! From Picardy". Extending Timeline API for track control of haptics, subtitles, and shaders. Custom XR Toolkit scripts, AR and 3D Storyline interactions, a magnetometer controller for creating a parallax effect, a haptic native plugin to access the UI Kit, and an AR Pi√±ata experience. Scripts I loved working on.
